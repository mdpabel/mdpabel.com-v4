WP Compatibility Patch name of the plugin inside wp-content/plugins, but it is hidden in dashboard. I fixed over 250+ sites last year that has the plugin, it create a hidden user as administrator. sometimes the user is hidden from the dashboard, but we can see in the phpMyAdmin. after removing the fake plugin, we need to remove the fake user, also need to take backup before doing that. another important thing to check is the posts, the sites that had the plugin, most of the time the sites also had fake posts.
