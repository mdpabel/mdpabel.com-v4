  "content": "<p><strong>WordPress</strong> is the CMS that has the largest market share and powers <strong>33%</strong> of all websites on the web.</p>\n<p>Due to its popularity, WordPress faces approximately <strong>90,000 attacks per minute</strong>.</p>\n<p>So, whenever you notice something unusual on your WordPress website, <strong>I am afraid that your website has been infected with malware.</strong></p>\n<p>That’s why I came up with a blog on <strong>WordPress malware removal</strong> where you can <strong>fix hacked WordPress site in just a few steps.</strong></p>\n<p>But yes, before proceeding, you should know some <strong>common types of malware</strong> that you can see most frequently on your website:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Trojan/Backdoor:</strong> Hackers insert malicious code into themes, plugins, or core files to maintain persistent access.</li>\n<li><strong>File-infecting Viruses:</strong> Rare but can infect PHP files, altering website behaviour or redirecting visitors.</li>\n<li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> It encrypts site files or databases, demanding a ransom.</li>\n<li><strong>Spyware/ Keyloggers:</strong> Can be hidden in plugins or themes to steal credentials and user data.</li>\n<li><strong>Adware:</strong> Often injected into sites to display unwanted ads to visitors.</li>\n<li><strong>Botnet Malware:</strong> Compromised sites may be used to send spam emails or participate in DDoS attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>SEO Spam/ Malicious Redirects:</strong> Not a traditional malware type, but often a result of hacked plugins/themes, affecting search engine ranking.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, for a more comprehensive list of malware, you can read my blog further on &#8220;<strong><a href=\"https://www.mdpabel.com/blog/most-common-wordpress-malware-in-mid-2025-what-ive-seen-fixing-thousands-of-hacked-sites\">Most Common WordPress Malware in 2025</a>.</strong>&#8221;</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Detect Malware on Your WordPress Website</strong></h2>\n<p>Understanding the basics of malware will make you eager to learn how to detect it. And it&#8217;s your instincts and site performance that will tell you whether you are hacked or not.</p>\n<p>Consider the following reasons to convince yourself that your site has been hacked:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>You will see spam appearing in your site&#8217;s header or footer</strong> that contains advertisements, such as pornography, drugs, or illegal services.</li>\n<li>They usually appear as <strong>dark text on a dark background</strong> and are not very visible to the human eye (but search engines can detect them).</li>\n<li>You search for your website, and your <strong>WordPress site redirecting to spam or somewhere else.</strong> Often, attackers inject malicious redirects to send your traffic to their ads or spam pages to improve their SEO rankings and hijack your traffic.</li>\n<li>Some malware consumes significant server resources, making your site <strong>very slow</strong> and increasing its load time. Though this is rare, you should stay alert.</li>\n<li>You are having <strong>strange-looking JavaScript code in your WordPress core.</strong> Attackers often use obfuscation techniques, formatting, and code comments to conceal their malware from view.</li>\n<li>Even a small snippet of <strong>malicious JavaScript</strong> can be used to redirect website traffic, harvest credit card details, or steal passwords from a hacked website.</li>\n<li>Sometimes your audience may report that they are being <strong>redirected to a malicious or spammy website.</strong></li>\n<li>These hacks will detect that you are the site administrator and will not show you anything spammy; instead, they will <strong>show spam to your visitors or search engines.</strong></li>\n<li>You receive a report from your hosting provider that your website is engaging in <strong>malicious or spammy behaviour.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Otherwise, you can try these automatic methods to detect malware for your website, too. Read this blog post to know further.</p>\n<p><strong>Now let’s walk through the steps on how to remove malware from WordPress site.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Step 1: Put Your Site in Maintenance Mode</strong></h3>\n<p>Whenever you suspect your WordPress site has been compromised, <strong>immediately restrict its access</strong> to prevent users from visiting it.</p>\n<p>You can do this by <strong>enabling restricted mode</strong>, which hides your website content from visitors and displays a message informing them that your site will be back soon.</p>\n<p>However, the <strong>default WordPress version does not let you control maintenance mode.</strong> Here are three ways you can activate WordPress maintenance mode on your site.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>modifying the .htaccess file</strong></li>\n<li><strong>adding a custom function</strong>, and</li>\n<li><strong>using a maintenance plugin</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Among the three options, I will use the <strong>easiest plugin method</strong> because it’s suitable for non-technical users as well.</p>\n<p>You can use a plugin like <strong>“LightStart,” “SeedProd,” or “Site Offline”</strong> to complete your task. These free tools enable you to easily activate maintenance mode on your site with just a few clicks.</p>\n<p>We will do the demonstration by picking one. Let&#8217;s assume <strong>“SeedProd.”</strong></p>\n<p>Just install and activate the SeedProd plugin and follow this guide to continue:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Open the SeedProd tab</strong> on the left sidebar of your WordPress dashboard and select Set up a Maintenance Mode Page.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose a free maintenance mode page template</strong> from the library and save it. You can also modify or edit the template further.</li>\n<li>Then click the cross symbol on the top right corner of the editor. SeedProd will prompt you to enable maintenance mode. <strong>Select “Yes” to activate it.</strong></li>\n<li>You will return to the SeedProd dashboard. <strong>Highlight the toggle</strong> to ensure that the Maintenance Mode setting is Active.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1251 aligncenter\" src=\"https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image3-300x119.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"769\" height=\"305\" srcset=\"https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image3-300x119.png 300w, https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image3-768x305.png 768w, https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image3.png 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Step 2: Backup your WordPress Files</strong></h3>\n<p>Before making any changes to your website, the second you can do is to <strong>take a full backup of your website.</strong></p>\n<p>There are two things you’ll need to back up,</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Your Database:</strong> Where your content, settings, and user information are stored.</li>\n<li><strong>and Your Files:</strong> The other items, such as your themes, plugins, and images.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The easiest way to take a site backup is using a WordPress plugin. There are free WordPress plugins, such as <strong>UpdraftPlus, All in one wp migration, and Jetpack</strong>, that can help you accomplish your task.</p>\n<p>However, you can back up your WordPress site manually, too, by using <b>cPanel/file manager </b>and <strong>phpMyAdmin.</strong></p>\n<p>Most users skip the manual option to back up files because it&#8217;s <strong>technically difficult</strong>, has a <strong>steep learning curve</strong>, and requires a <strong>significant amount of time</strong> to complete.</p>\n<p>Anyways, if you don&#8217;t know how to make this happen, you can check this full guide on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-backup-your-wordpress-site/\"><strong>how to take a backup of your WordPress website</strong></a> to continue.</p>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Tip:</strong> Store the backup outside of your hosting server (Google Drive, Dropbox, or local computer). If your hosting is compromised, local backups are useless.</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 3: Replace Core WordPress Files &amp; Update Themes/Plugins</strong></h3>\n<p>When a <strong>WordPress site hacked with malware</strong>, it often hides inside the core files (like wp-config.php, wp-includes, or even the index.php).</p>\n<p>Hackers inject malicious code into these files because they’re <strong>loaded every time your site runs</strong>, giving them easy access to spread malware or steal data.</p>\n<p><strong>Replacing the core WordPress files</strong> can be one of the steps. You can make it in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Automatic Process:</strong> This is the easiest way to replace core WordPress files. Just use the built-in reinstallation feature in your WordPress dashboard by navigating to Dashboard &gt; Updates and clicking &#8220;Re-install Now&#8221;.</li>\n<li><strong>Manual Process:</strong> Second, you can fix it by downloading a fresh installation from <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress.org</a> and replacing each compromised file with a clean copy.<br />\nTo do so, just extract the downloaded files on your computer, delete the “wp-content” folder from the extracted files, and then upload the rest to your website (using FTP or your host’s file manager). <strong>Replace the old files when asked.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>After having these, you have to <strong>update your themes and plugins.</strong> This ensures that you have applied the latest patch, minimizing the known attack surface for hackers.</p>\n<p>To update themes and plugins-</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Go to your site&#8217;s dashboard and navigate to the <strong>Dashboard &gt; Updates</strong> page or the <strong>Plugins &gt; Installed Plugins</strong> page</li>\n<li>Then click the <strong>&#8220;Update Now&#8221;</strong> link or select multiple items from the list to update them in bulk.</li>\n<li>However, today&#8217;s WordPress ecosystem is built with an <strong>automatic update system.</strong> So, you don’t need to bother with this update section unless you <strong>turn off the automatic update</strong> option manually in the themes and plugins.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Hackers are more likely to target <a href=\"https://www.mdpabel.com/blog/comprehensive-list-of-known-fake-and-malicious-wordpress-plugins\"><strong>abandoned plugins and themes</strong></a> because developers no longer patch known vulnerabilities. So, stay alert when you are using them.</p>\n<p><strong>⚠️ Tips:</strong> Avoid <strong>nulled/pirated plugins</strong>&#8211; they’re one of the most common infection sources.</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 4: Scan with Security Tools</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that your files have been replaced, <strong>run deep scans</strong> to detect any hidden malware. You can make this possible in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Just scan your site with a <strong>security plugin</strong>. You can use <strong>“<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wordfence Security</a>,” “<a href=\"https://sitecheck.sucuri.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sitecheck Sucuri</a>,” or “MalCare,”</strong> which are the best for scanning malware signatures and suspicious files.</li>\n<li>Or try an <strong>online WordPress malware scanner.</strong> Among them, <strong>“VirusTotal”</strong> and <strong>“Quttera”</strong> serve best in their field.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To provide a better understanding, I will use the <strong>Wordfence</strong> plugin in this tutorial. I found it to be one of the best WordPress security service plugins on the internet.</p>\n<p>Simply follow these steps to continue:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to your WordPress dashboard, click on <strong>“Plugins&gt; Add New.”</strong> Search for <strong>“Wordfence,”</strong> install the plugin, and activate it.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1253 aligncenter\" src=\"https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image5-300x150.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"744\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image5-300x150.gif 300w, https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image5-768x385.gif 768w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 744px) 100vw, 744px\" /></li>\n<li>Next, go to <strong>Wordfence</strong>(left below) in your WordPress dashboard and click on <strong>“Scan.”</strong></li>\n<li>Choose the <strong>“Scan Type” as “Full Scan”</strong> and click on the <strong>“Start New Scan”</strong> button. Wordfence will now scan your website for malware.<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1254 aligncenter\" src=\"https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image6-300x105.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"761\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image6-300x105.png 300w, https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image6-768x269.png 768w, https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image6.png 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px\" /></li>\n<li>After completing the scan, Wordfence will display a list of identified issues. <strong>Review the results carefully</strong> and identify any malware or suspicious files.</li>\n<li>Then <strong>quarantine or remove</strong> the identified malware. In the scan results, locate the malware files, and select the action you want to take (clean or delete).<img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1250 aligncenter\" src=\"https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-300x136.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"752\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-300x136.png 300w, https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2-768x347.png 768w, https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image2.png 1024w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 752px) 100vw, 752px\" /></li>\n</ol>\n<h3><strong>Step 5: Scan Your Database for Malware</strong></h3>\n<p>Most security plugins only scan files, <strong>not the database.</strong></p>\n<p>Some free versions of plugins allow you to check the database file, but they’re <strong>too limited</strong> for WordPress malware cleanup. And the best WordPress virus removal(database) comes with the premium version of a few plugins.</p>\n<p>That’s why hackers have the option to <strong>hide malicious code inside your database.</strong> If you don’t check it, the infection can persist even after you’ve cleaned your site files.</p>\n<p>Some of the most common database targets are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Wp_posts:</strong> Hackers may insert hidden spam content, fake redirects, or malicious scripts inside your posts and pages.</li>\n<li><strong>Wp_options:</strong> Attackers sometimes inject harmful JavaScript or iframes into your site’s settings.</li>\n<li><strong>Custom plugin tables:</strong> Certain plugins create their own tables, which hackers can also exploit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, the best method is to use a <strong>plugin + manual scan</strong> to make your website malware-free.</p>\n<p>As I have made a move in step 4 with plugin checking. Here, I will guide you through the <strong>manual scan process.</strong></p>\n<p>To check this:</p>\n<p><strong>Log in to phpMyAdmin</strong> (or your hosting’s database tool).</p>\n<p><strong>Search for suspicious code</strong>, such as base64, &lt;script&gt;, iframe, or unusual links. Here are more listings given below. Check them too.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\" wp-image-1249 aligncenter\" src=\"https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1-300x108.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"858\" height=\"309\" srcset=\"https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1-300x108.png 300w, https://cms.mdpabel.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1.png 738w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 858px) 100vw, 858px\" /></p>\n<p>1. <strong>Remove any spammy entries</strong> that you see.</p>\n<p><strong>⚠️Tips:</strong> Be careful; don’t delete legitimate entries. <strong>Always take a database backup</strong> before making any edits.</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 6: Reset Passwords &amp; Security Keys</strong></h3>\n<p>A compromised website means that your WordPress administrators’ credentials are <strong>exposed on the dark web.</strong> Any hacker can steal and use your website data.</p>\n<p>So, immediately <strong>resetting all passwords</strong> can give you some relief from a hack.</p>\n<p>It’s wise to update your credentials on other platforms as well, such as the <strong>WordPress database</strong>, <strong>hosting panel</strong>, and <strong>File Transfer Protocol (FTP) client.</strong></p>\n<p>To minimize security threats, use a <strong>robust and unique password</strong> for each of your accounts. You can use a password generator tool, such as <strong>1Password, NordPass, or Strong Password Generator,</strong> to make the process easier.</p>\n<p>Plus, you can <strong>store all your credentials</strong> in these applications, which provide an encrypted vault to safeguard your login information for the future.</p>\n<p>Finally, update your <a href=\"https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/wordpress-salts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>WordPress security keys (salts):</strong></a></p>\n<p>Go to <strong>WordPress Secret Key Generator:</strong> <a href=\"https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/\">https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Copy new salts.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Replace the existing ones</strong> in your wp-config.php file.</p>\n<p><strong>This step will log out all existing sessions and prevent stolen cookies from being reused.</strong></p>\n<h3><strong>Step 7: Remove Blacklist</strong></h3>\n<p>After a WordPress malware cleanup, your site might still appear as <strong>“dangerous”</strong> in search engines or browsers. So, all you have to do is <strong>remove your website URL from your search engine blacklist.</strong></p>\n<p>As <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\"><strong>89.57% users are from Google</strong></a>, that’s why, I will show you how to remove the blacklist using Google Search Console.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to fix it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Navigate to your Google Search Console&#8217;s admin dashboard</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Open the Security &amp; Manual Actions&gt; Security issues</strong> tab</li>\n<li><strong>Select I have fixed these issues&gt; Request a review</strong> to have Google review and re-index your WordPress site</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please note that <strong>Google may take a couple of days</strong> to process the blocklist removal request.</p>\n<p>I recommend that you do it immediately since the longer Google blocks your website, the more it <a href=\"https://www.mdpabel.com/blog/recovering-from-seo-spam-how-we-cleared-242000-japanese-spam-pages-from-a-hacked-wordpress-site-in-2025\">harms your website&#8217;s </a><strong>SEO and reputation.</strong></p>\n<p>However, there’s another way to get blacklisted if you use products from big security companies like <strong>McAfee, Norton, Yandex, Spamhaus,</strong> and others.</p>\n<p>As it will result in <strong>warnings</strong>(your visitors may see), or browsers may block your site.</p>\n<p>The solution is- these companies provide <strong>public forms</strong> where you can submit a request to review your site after you’ve done the WordPress malware cleanup.</p>\n<p>If they confirm it’s safe, they will <strong>remove your site from their blacklist</strong>, and the warnings will disappear.</p>\n<h3><strong>Step 8: Strengthen Security to Prevent Future Attacks</strong></h3>\n<p>Cleaning malware from your WordPress site is only half the battle; the real challenge is ensuring it <strong>doesn’t come back.</strong></p>\n<p>In most cases, the primary cause of malware infection is the website&#8217;s <strong>weak security.</strong> Hackers often exploit the same weak points, so <strong>strengthening your site’s security</strong> is the best option.</p>\n<p>Here are some steps that you can take to improve your WordPress website’s security:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that all your <strong>passwords are random strings</strong>, a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using dictionary phrases. Use a <strong>two-factor authentication plugin</strong> in WordPress.</li>\n<li><strong>Set proper file permissions</strong> in WordPress and <strong>remove any old backups</strong> present on the server. Instead, keep the backup securely on your local computer.</li>\n<li><strong>Change your WordPress admin URL</strong> to prevent attackers from brute-forcing login attempts and <strong>disabling file indexing.</strong></li>\n<li>Keep your <strong>WordPress core and themes/plugins up to date.</strong> Do not use <strong>null themes and plugins</strong> as they contain malware.</li>\n<li>Use <strong>SSL</strong> and install a plugin to <strong>force users to use HTTPS.</strong></li>\n<li>Follow <strong>secure coding practices</strong> for WordPress development while building something for your website.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhance the security of your server</strong> by blocking sensitive ports and utilizing subnetting on shared hosting.</li>\n<li>Use a <strong>WordPress firewall and security solution</strong> on your website. Additionally, <strong>conduct regular security audits</strong> to identify any vulnerabilities in your WordPress site before hackers do.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Hiring a WordPress Website Malware Removal Service</strong></h2>\n<p>If you tried all the steps we covered along with the plugin option, and still face issues, <strong>hiring a WordPress security professional is the last resort.</strong></p>\n<p>A professional can properly <strong>clean malware</strong> on your website, ensuring no malicious scripts or backdoors remain. Their expertise prevents you from deleting important files during the removal process to maintain functionality.</p>\n<p>Here you can <a href=\"https://www.mdpabel.com/wordpress-malware-removal\">check my profile</a>.
