  "content": "<p>There are about 30,000 websites that fall victim to hackers every day; there&#8217;s no guarantee your website won&#8217;t be next.</p>\n<p>Yes, <strong>WordPress</strong> is a security concern platform. But depending on the default settings can be a heavy risk for you.</p>\n<p>So, having precautions within WordPress is the first choice to protect your website.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s why I am into this blog to make you understand how you can keep your website hack-free in 2025.</p>\n<p>Want to know more? Let&#8217;s get started!</p>\n<h2>First, Know, Does WordPress Offer Built-In Security Features?</h2>\n<p>Yes, WordPress comes with several built-in security features. It includes <strong>password protection</strong>, regular core updates, <strong>user role management</strong>, and the ability to implement basic security practices like limiting login attempts.</p>\n<p>But <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/open-source/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">WordPress is an open-source platform</a>. That&#8217;s why anyone can access it and modify the code, which can lead to security vulnerabilities (if not properly managed).</p>\n<p>For this reason, many consider WordPress insecure due to its reliance on third-party plugins and themes, which may not always be well-maintained or secure.</p>\n<p>For example, outdated plugins or weakly coded themes can create vulnerabilities that hackers can exploit. Additionally, if users neglect to apply security updates, their sites become more prone to attacks.</p>\n<p>While WordPress provides a foundation for security, it&#8217;s keep in mind that the site owner is ultimately responsible for maintaining and securing their website.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Security vs. Other Website Builders&#8217; Security</h2>\n<p>While WordPress feels insecure, most people are moving forward to other web builders like <a href=\"https://www.wix.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wix</a> or <a href=\"https://www.shopify.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Shopify</a>.</p>\n<p>But there remains a question- what are the key differences in terms of flexibility and control over security for these web builders?</p>\n<p>Wix and Shopify are both managed platforms, meaning they take care of <a href=\"https://www.mdpabel.com/blog/wordpress-security-tips-every-website-owner-must-know\">most security concerns</a> for you. Updates, security patches, and backups are handled automatically, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about maintaining the site&#8217;s security.</p>\n<p>Here are some more you can eye over as security concerns for WordPress vs other web builders:</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Security Feature</strong></th>\n<th><strong>For WordPress</strong></th>\n<th><strong>For other web builders</strong> (like Wix + Shopify)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Control over Security</strong></td>\n<td>Full control; can install plugins, custom firewalls</td>\n<td>Limited control; relies on built-in security</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Updates &amp; Patches</strong></td>\n<td>Regular updates required (manual or automated)</td>\n<td>Automatic updates; no user responsibility</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Firewall &amp; Malware Protection</strong></td>\n<td>Optional via plugins (e.g., Wordfence, Sucuri)</td>\n<td>Built-in protection with automatic monitoring</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>SSL Certificate</strong></td>\n<td>User must install and configure</td>\n<td>SSL included for all sites</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</strong></td>\n<td>Available via plugins</td>\n<td>Built-in feature for enhanced security</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Security Plugins</strong></td>\n<td>Wide variety of plugins (e.g., iThemes, Sucuri)</td>\n<td>No plugin support; security is handled internally</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Backup and Restore</strong></td>\n<td>Can be configured with plugins (e.g., UpdraftPlus)</td>\n<td>Built-in backup system, but less flexible</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Vulnerability Patching</strong></td>\n<td>User responsibility for patching themes/plugins</td>\n<td>Handled by Wix automatically</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Custom Security Features</strong></td>\n<td>Full customization available through plugins</td>\n<td>No customization; all security is built-in</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>So, What are the Top WordPress Security Concerns in 2025?</h2>\n<p>Despite its robust capabilities, WordPress faces several ongoing security concerns, especially as the platform grows in popularity. Here are some of the top security risks in 2025:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/brute-force-attack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Brute-force attacks</a>:</strong> Hackers use automated tools to guess passwords and gain access to admin areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Plugin vulnerabilities:</strong> Outdated or poorly coded plugins remain one of the primary entry points for hackers.</li>\n<li><strong>SQL injections:</strong> Malicious code inserted into a site&#8217;s database can lead to unauthorized access or data manipulation.</li>\n<li><strong>Malware and ransomware:</strong> WordPress sites, especially those without adequate security measures, can be infected with <a href=\"https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/types-of-malware\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">malicious software that steals</a> data or locks users out of their sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Understanding these threats is the first step in preventing them. Regular updates, strong passwords, and proper security configurations can significantly mitigate these risks.</p>\n<h2>Most Common Vulnerabilities in WordPress &amp; How They Can Affect Your Website?</h2>\n<p>WordPress vulnerabilities can stem from several sources, but the most common include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Outdated plugins and themes:</strong> One of the biggest weaknesses in WordPress security comes from plugins and themes that haven&#8217;t been updated. Older versions may have security flaws that hackers can exploit.</li>\n<li><strong>Weak passwords:</strong> Weak or commonly used passwords are easy targets for brute-force attacks. Admin areas are often the primary focus of these attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>User permissions:</strong> Misconfigured user roles can lead to unauthorized access. For example, giving unnecessary permissions to users can increase the risk of malicious changes being made to your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To protect against these vulnerabilities, it&#8217;s important always to use well-maintained plugins, set up strong passwords, and regularly review user permissions.</p>\n<h2>How WordPress handles Security Updates and Patches?</h2>\n<p>WordPress is a security concern platform. If it finds any vulnerabilities, it will fix them with its regular core updates. And the best part is- these <a href=\"https://www.hostinger.com/in/tutorials/wordpress-auto-update\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">updates are automatically installed</a>, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about keeping up with them manually.</p>\n<p>However, while WordPress itself updates automatically, your website&#8217;s plugins and themes don&#8217;t (by default). They need to be updated manually, and this is where a lot of vulnerabilities can creep in.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, you will find that developers often release patches for plugins and themes to address newly discovered security threats. This also makes it crucial to stay on top of these updates to keep your site safe.</p>\n<p>So, always keeping up to date means you have created a much stronger defense against common cyberattacks and minimize the risk of your site being compromised. It&#8217;s an easy yet effective way to safeguard your website from the ever-evolving threats of the digital world.</p>\n<p>However, to ensure your WordPress site remains more secure, follow these best practices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use strong, unique passwords:</strong> Protect your admin area with strong passwords and consider using a password manager to keep track of them.</li>\n<li><strong>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA):</strong> Add an extra layer of protection to your login process by requiring a second form of verification.</li>\n<li><strong>Backup regularly:</strong> Keep regular backups of your website and database in case of emergencies or security breaches.</li>\n<li><strong>Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):</strong> A WAF helps <a href=\"https://www.mdpabel.com/blog/htaccess-malware-how-hackers-hide-redirects-and-how-to-remove-them-fast\">block malicious traffic</a> before it even reaches your site.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Expert Tips to Keep Your Site Secure</h2>\n<p>As you learned the best practices above, here are a few expert tips to keep your WordPress site extra secure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Monitor user activity:</strong> Install plugins that log user activity to track and respond to suspicious actions.</li>\n<li><strong>Limit login attempts:</strong> Block IP addresses that attempt too many login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.</li>\n<li><strong>Disable XML-RPC:</strong> It&#8217;s wise to disable XML-RPC to prevent attacks that exploit.</li>\n<li><strong>Choose a reputable hosting provider:</strong> Make sure your hosting provider implements security measures like SSL, firewalls, and DDoS protection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Now, what should You Do if your WordPress Website Gets Hacked?</h2>\n<p>As you are unfamiliar with the complete WordPress security system, it&#8217;s wise to take immediate aftermath.</p>\n<p>So, I am doing that for you. If your WordPress website gets hacked, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Disconnect your site from the web:</strong> to prevent further damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Run a malware scan:</strong> to locate the source of the hack.</li>\n<li>If you have clean backups, <strong>restore them</strong> to bring your site back online.</li>\n<li>After restoring, <strong>update all passwords, plugins, and themes</strong> to the latest versions.</li>\n<li>Use this opportunity to implement stronger security measures, such as <strong>2FA</strong> and a <strong>WAF</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Also, prompt action and a recovery plan can significantly reduce the damage caused by a hack.</p>\n<h2>What Are the Best Service Providers for WordPress Malware Removal?</h2>\n<p>Let&#8217;s say, doing the above fixes can&#8217;t give you a proper solution, so then you will need some better service providers for <a href=\"https://www.mdpabel.com/blog/wordpress-malware-removal-expert-guide-to-clean-hacked-wordpress-site\">WordPress malware removal</a>.</p>\n<p>Though there are many, with over 7 years of experience in the field, I can confidently recommend these as the most trustworthy sources you can try for WordPress malware removal.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://sucuri.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sucuri</a>:</strong> One of the most well-known names in website security.
