  "content": "<h2>Why Two‑Factor Authentication Matters</h2>\n<p>Your WordPress login page is the gateway to your entire website. Without 2FA, you rely solely on a password that could be guessed or leaked. Two‑factor authentication adds a second layer of security: a unique, time‑based code generated on your phone. Wordfence includes a built‑in login security module so you can enable 2FA without extra plugins. This guide walks you through the steps.</p>\n<h2>Step 1: Install and Activate the Wordfence Plugin</h2>\n<p>If you haven’t installed Wordfence yet, log in to your WordPress dashboard and navigate to <em>Plugins → Add New</em>. Search for “Wordfence Security – Firewall &#038; Malware Scan” and click <strong>Install Now</strong>, then <strong>Activate</strong>. Wordfence provides an endpoint firewall, malware scanner and login security features in one package.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ps.w.org/wordfence/assets/screenshot-14.png\" alt=\"Wordfence dashboard showing firewall and scan status\"></p>\n<h2>Step 2: Open the Login Security Module</h2>\n<p>Once Wordfence is activated, you’ll see a new <strong>Wordfence</strong> menu in your admin sidebar. Hover over it and select <em>Login Security</em>. The dashboard summarises your login security status with options for Two‑Factor Authentication and CAPTCHA protection. Click the <strong>Two‑Factor Authentication</strong> tab to proceed.</p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://ps.w.org/wordfence/assets/screenshot-15.png\" alt=\"Wordfence two-factor authentication setup page with QR code\"></p>\n<h2>Step 3: Set Up Two‑Factor Authentication</h2>\n<p>On the Two‑Factor Authentication page you’ll see a QR code. Open a TOTP authenticator app such as Google Authenticator, Authy or 1Password on your phone and scan the QR code. The app will generate a six‑digit code that changes every 30 seconds. Enter the code into the <strong>Authentication Code</strong> field and click <strong>Activate</strong>.</p>\n<p>Wordfence will display a list of recovery codes. Download or copy these codes and store them in a safe location. You can use them if you lose access to your authenticator app.</p>\n<h2>Step 4: Require 2FA for Administrators and Users</h2>\n<p>To protect other users, go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab in the Login Security module. Here you can enable “Require 2FA for all administrators” and optionally force 2FA for editors, authors or custom roles. This ensures everyone with elevated privileges uses 2FA.</p>\n<h2>Step 5: Test and Backup Your Codes</h2>\n<p>Log out of WordPress and log back in. After entering your username and password, Wordfence will prompt you for a verification code from your authenticator app. Enter the six‑digit code to complete the login. Keep your recovery codes safe in case you lose your phone.</p>\n<h2>Other 2FA Plugins Worth Considering</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Two Factor</strong> – the official WordPress plugin that adds 2FA via email, TOTP or backup codes without any extras.</li>\n<li><strong>WP 2FA</strong> – a user‑friendly plugin from WP White Security that allows administrators to enforce 2FA for specific roles and offers guided setup.</li>\n<li><strong>miniOrange Google Authenticator</strong> – supports TOTP, email and SMS codes and integrates with custom login pages or WooCommerce.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Two‑Factor Authentication is one of the simplest and most effective ways to secure your WordPress login from brute‑force attacks and stolen credentials. Wordfence makes it easy to enable 2FA with a built‑in QR code generator and granular settings to enforce it for high‑risk users. Combine 2FA with strong passwords, automatic updates and regular security scans to keep your site safe in 2025 and beyond.</p>\n",
